      <p>WebSSO is a new cloud-centric, federated authentication system
         developed to solve the problems of deploying authentication across
         heterogeneous infrastructures. It is a thin policy layer on top of
         widely deployed and trusted protocols such as HTTPS and TLS client
         certificate authentication. It provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single sign-on across local, Internet and cloud
            infrastructures</li>
        <li>Globally unique identities via existing certificate
            authorities</li>
        <li>Decentralized authentication</li>
        <li>Credential delegation</li>
        <li>Depoyment on existing HTTPS stacks</li>
        <li>Multi-protocol support (i.e. not restricted to HTTP)</li>
        <li>Cryptographic trust validation of all parties</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="why">WebSSO's Motivation</h3>
      <p>It is true, there are lots of authentication protocols available.
         Kerberos, for instance, is a widely deployed, mature protocol for
         local infrastructure. However, it has almost no Internet presence,
         mostly because identity providers are not willing to expose their
         Kerberos servers to the Internet. Kerberos also competes in the
         encryption space with SSL/TLS, the hands down winner in the
         web-enabled world. Lastly, Kerberos has difficulty scaling in large,
         flat topologies.</p>
         
      <p>Outside of the enterprise context, OpenID has a large presence on the
         Internet. As one of the first attempts at creating a federated
         identity system in the Internet, it has accomplished remarkable things.
         However, OpenID doesn't do single sign-on. Nor does it validate all
         parties in the authentication transaction, leading to <a
         href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#Security">problems with
         security/phishing</a>. When combined with OAuth, OpenID can perform
         credential delegation. But implementing these protocols is quite
         complex, leading to bugs that compromise security. OpenID is also
         tightly tied with the web-based world and has gained no traction
         outside this environment.</p>
         
      <p>The true problem arises when the local infrastructure and Internet
         worlds meet. If you want to use your enterprise identity on the
         Internet or in a cloud service, you're pretty much out of luck. The
         same is mostly true with using your Internet identity in the
         enterprise. Thus, webSSO came about as we began to envision a world
         where there was no division between local, Internet and cloud
         infrastructures.</p>
      
      <h3 id="ux">User Experience</h3>
      <p>When a user first encounters a webSSO Protected Resource, he or she
         will be prompted to log in. In this case, the user has not acquired
         any identities and the Protected Resource has suggested that the user
         can use Facebook or Yahoo! to log in.</p>
      <img src="images/workflow1.png" />
      
      <p>Since the user wants to use his own webSSO identity, he types in his
         user ID and domain and clicks add. The client will look up this user's
         webSSO server and attempt to login:</p>
      <img src="images/workflow2.png" />
      
      <p>Once the user has established his/her webSSO identity, it can be used
         for subsequent logins without entering credentials again:</p>
      <img src="images/workflow3.png" />
      
      <p>WebSSO can also be used in conjunction with traditional X.509
         certificates:</p>
      <img src="images/workflow4.png" />
      
      <p>When a Protected Resource desires to acquire data from another
         Protected Resource, it can prompt the user to grant it access. This
         is called delegation:</p>
      <img src="images/workflow5.png" />   
      
      <h3 id="how">Under the Covers</h3>
      <p>A typical authentication system looks something like this:</p>
      <img src="images/typical.png" />
      <p>SSL/TLS client certificate authentication provides a unique feature in
         that the Authentication Service (which issues the certificate) and the
         Protected Resource do not need to communicate. This permits the
         Authentication Service to live behind a firewall. The downside is that
         the process for obtaining a certificate has typically been manual and
         error prone:</p>
      <img src="images/tls.png" />
      
      <p>WebSSO is a simple policy layer on top of SSL/TLS client certificate
         authentication. When connecting to a SSL/TLS-encrypted resource, the
         resource can ask you to authenticate by providing a certificate. In
         a traditional TLS transaction, if you don't have a certificate the
         operation simply fails. However, in the webSSO case, if you do not
         have an appropriate certificate, you can simply use webSSO to obtain
         one:</p>
      <img src="images/overview.png" />
      
      <p>The end result is that we get the benefit of TLS authentication
         without the drawback of the manual process:</p>
      <img src="images/webSSO.png" />
         
      <h3 id="identities">Globally Unique Identities</h3>
      <p>WebSSO can provide private trust relationships via manual certificate
         exchange. But one of the more interesting features of WebSSO is its
         ability to provide globally unique identities. This works by utilizing
         the pre-existing system of public X.509 certificate authorities to
         validate domain ownership. For instance, if you want to bring up a
         secure website on example.com, you will need to obtain a certificate
         from a trusted certificate authority. This authority will verify that
         you are the proper owner of your domain and issue you a certificate
         vouching for this.</p>
         
      <img src="images/certificates.png"/>
      <p>WebSSO is really no different. If you want to bring up an
         Authentication Service, you obtain a certificate from an authority
         proving your domain (example.com). This permits you to issue user
         certificates for user@example.com.</p>
      
      <h3 id="protocols">Crossing Enterprise Boundaries</h3>
      <p>In webSSO, authentication is provided at the SSL/TLS encryption
         channel layer. This means that webSSO can be used wherever SSL/TLS
         encryption is used to protect a connection. This feature is what
         permits webSSO to work transparently across local, Internet and cloud
         infrastructures. For instance, you can use the same identity to log in
         to your local print and file shares, web sites such as Facebook and
         Google, and privately contracted cloud services such as HR or
         virtualization.</p>
         
      <p>However, many organizations are unwilling (for good reason) to expose
         their Authentication Service to the Internet. WebSSO was designed
         precisely for this scenario. Since webSSO does not require any contact
         between the Authentication Service and the Protected Resources to whom
         authentication will be provided, you can safely host your webSSO server
         behind the corporate firewall and still permit the use of corporate
         identities in the public Internet.</p>
         
      <h3 id="delegation">Secure Credential Delegation</h3>
      <p>Sharing data between services has become a critical feature of today's
         modern web services. Yet most attempts at authentication when sharing
         data have been handled by proprietary mechanisms or, more recently,
         the OAuth protocol. In both cases this has been restricted to HTTP-
         only services. Existing forms of delegation have also created an
         atmosphere where sharing is unbounded and requires the sharing of
         passwords.</p>
         
      <p>WebSSO aims to provide an authentication delegation system which:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Works across any protocol</li>
        <li>Permits cryptographic trust validation of every party involved</li>
        <li>Enforces time limits on all delegation grants</li>
        <li>Does not require the exchange of passwords</li>
      </ul>
